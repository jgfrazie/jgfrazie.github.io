<p>Hello! I'm James Frazier, an undergraduate student at Hamilton College, Class of 2024. I have a passion for Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Mathematics, with a specific focus on Artificial Intelligence, Genetic Programming, and Graph Theory. I am currently a Senior Fellow of the college conducting research in the young field of <emph>Adversarial Genetic Programming for Cybersecurity</emph>.  I also am assisting <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z_nA0YoAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Thomas Helmuth</a> with his research into Human-Driven Genetic Programming (HDGP) and am a proud member of the <a href="http://mochiresearch.com/">MoCHI</a> research lab.</p>

## Education
- Senior Fellow of _Applications of Artificial Intelligence to Information Privacy_, Hamilton College (Expected Year of Graduation: 2024)
- Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Hamilton College (Expected Year of Graduation: 2024)
- Minor in Mathematics, Hamilton College (Expected Year of Graduation: 2024)

<!-- ## Research Experience
- Published Paper: "Human-Driven Genetic Programming," Second Author, with Professor Thomas Helmuth.
   - Provide a brief description of the paper's topic and any notable findings.
   - Mention the significance and impact of the research. -->

## Research Experience
- <strong>Published Paper: _Human-Driven Genetic Programming for Program Synthesis: A Prototype_, Second Author, with Dr. Thomas Helmuth, Ahmed Farghali Abdelrehim, and Yuhan Shi.</strong>
   - We developed a prototype for a Genetic Programming algorithm called Human-Driven Genetic Programming (HDGP) which can use as few as 5 initial training cases to start and, with assistance from a user, can solve many problems a regular Genetic Programming Program Synthesis algorithm can.
   - The researched showed it is not only possible to include a human in the evolutionary loop of Genetic Programming algorithms but also achieve similar results to other algorithms. Also, by utilizing Lexicase Parent Selection and Counterexample-Driven Genetic Programming (CDGP), it is possible to begin work on a completely new problem with little to no starting data.

- <b>DriveGroups Project, with [Dr. Sarah Morrison-Smith](https://sarahmorrisonsmith.com/).</b>
   - Collaborated with Dr. Morrison-Smith on the development of DriveGroups, an add-on to Google Drive aimed at enhancing file sharing capabilities and streamlining data flow in research groups.
   - As a Project Lead, I was responsible for conducting weekly meetings with Dr. Morrison-Smith and several peer undergraduate students. We conducted various types of in-person tests with a developed prototype of an application which enhances the Google Drive experience. It does so by introducing the idea of a DriveGroup where a collection of emails is treated as one entity which can have all of the same privilages and information sharing capabilities as an individual with just one email.
   - I was chosen as a Project Lead for the DriveGroups research conducted by the [MoCHI](http://mochiresearch.com/) research lab from January 18th, 2023 to the present.

## Current Role
- _Senior Fellow_, Hamilton College
   - As a Senior Fellow, I will be conducting research into the _Applications of Artificial Intelligence into Information Privacy_. More precisely, I will be investigating the young field of [_Adversarial Genetic Programming for Cybersecurity_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04647#:~:text=Cyber%20security%20adversaries%20and%20engagements,the%20dynamics%20of%20their%20engagements.), where I hope to develop a(n) algorithm(s) utilizing coevolutionary techniques with Genetic Programming systems to simulate cybersecurity arms races.
   - A more in-depth description of what being a Senior Fellow of Hamilton College means can be found [here](https://www.hamilton.edu/academics/seniorfellows). Simply put, I submitted a research proposal to the Academic Counsil of Hamilton College and had my proposal accepted. Thus, instead of completing a traditional concentration (Hamilton College's version of a major), I now will conduct intensive research in place of classwork, as the Academic Counsil has found it more beneficial for me to conduct research with the professors of Hamilton College than to complete the rest of my requirements for my concentration. By the end of the 2023 - 24 academic year, I will have produced a master's thesis and given a public lecture to the college over my proposed research (and most likely produced at least one original work of research to be published).

## Areas of Focus
- Artificial Intelligence: Currently, I am utilizing various AI techniques in my research over the 2023 - 24 academic year. However, my work in artificial intelligence overall is not as in-depth as my work into Genetic Programming. However, I have made systems which utilize search space, decision, and evolutionary algorithms along with developing a neural network from scratch, all of which I can show if you are interested (which I cannot publically post due to my disclosure agreement). You can [email me](mailto: james.frazier8093@gmail.com) if you are interested.
- Genetic Programming: I have not only taken classes on Artificial Intelligence and Genetic Programming at Hamilton College, I also have done research with [Dr. Thomas Helmuth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z_nA0YoAAAAJ&hl=en) on Genetic Programming. As a Senior Fellow of Hamilton College, I am also investigating the applications of artificial intelligence to information privacy; more specifically, I am looking into _Adversarial Genetic Programming for Cybersecurity_ to simulate arms races and possibly predict vulnerabilities in a network. You can find some of my work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jgfrazie) or ask me for other examples I may have.
- Graph Theory: I have taken classes on Graph Theory at Hamilton College in the Math and Computer Science departments and currently use the techniques learned to develop _battlefields_ for cybersecurity arms race simulations as part of my research.

## Projects
- _Gush_: _Gush_ is a [Push Interpreter](https://lspector.github.io/interpush/) in the programming language [_Go_](https://go.dev/). Push is utilized mostly as a way of allowing a Genetic Programming system to synthesize a program while avoiding many of the issues a program synthesized with an _Abstract Syntax Tree_ would have. This project is currently under development and should hopefully have a working version made public by the end of 2023.
- _Adversarial Genetic Programming Simulator_: (NOT FINALIZED) My research project for the 2023 - 24 academic year at Hamilton College. More information to be anounced.
- Various AI Projects: I have completed several projects as part of my previous classwork such as developing a neural network from scratch, implementing several search space algorithms, and more. If you would like to see of these examples, do not hesitate to [email](mailto:james.frazier8093@gmail.com) me.
- MISC: From a legal case-file organizing system in _C++_ to metacircular interpreters in _Clojure_, I've done a lot of random projects that you may find interesting. If you can't find something on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jgfrazie), then I may have done it as part of a class project. If so, do not hesitate to [email](mailto:james.frazier8093@gmail.com) me.

## Conclusion
Many of the wonderful inventions we take for granted today were pet projects before they became famous (i.e. encryption techniques and [_Clojure_](https://clojure.org/)), and I feel Genetic Programming and much of artificial intelligence will follow suit: just look at what [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) has been able to accomplish! That being said, I hope to be at the forefront of AI's development in the near future.
